	<h1>Katty Larrosa</h1>
	<p>I am a Phisycal Education and a Computing Teacher. I work all day and enjoy every aspect of my life.
	Trying to find new challenges, is that I was learning how to code, something I have tried before as a hobbie, many years ago...<br> It's not easy to have the vision in order to create beautiful, responsive and eficient sites. I believe that working hard is the best way of reach all those I mention before! <br>
